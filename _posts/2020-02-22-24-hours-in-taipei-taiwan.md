title: '24 Hours in Taipei, Taiwan'
---
This past summer, my friend and I somehow managed to plan our flights back to the states so that we'd have a 24 hour layover in Taipei. Taiwan wasn't on our East Asia itinerary, but we figured if the flights worked out, why take a free-ish trip? So we flew out of Osaka at 10PM and landed in Taipei at midnight. Our flight from Taipei to Seattle was the next day at 11:40PM, so thus began an interesting 24 hours...

Major disclosure- we walked a LOT. We were lowkey broke at this point and weren't trying to take out a ton of cash for just the day. That being said, the areas we walked were all along subway paths. We just felt like we'd see more of the city (& save money) if we walked. 

12AM - We land at Taipei Taoyuan International Airport. Obviously nothing was open at this time and we didn't want to bother going into the city to get a hostel, so after looking around the entire terminal, we found some extremely uncomfortable wooden benches to sleep on for the next 5-6 hours.

6AM - We checked our non-essential carry-ons into the day lockers at the airport and hopped on the train to go downtown. The airport is quite a ways away from the city center, so it took about 45 minutes. The views on the way though were AMAZING, you get a glimpse into the countryside and everything looks like it's out of a Studio Ghibli movie. Jaw-dropping. 

8AM - We arrived at Taipei Station and from there walked in SEARING HEAT to Ximending Walking District, which if it wasn't 830AM in the morning would have been extremely bustling with food vendors, game centers, and retaurants. Even at this hour, there were a ton of people grabbing breakfast, so we stopped by the famous Yong He Soy Milk for a heart-wrenchingly nostalgic soy milk and green onion/egg pancake breakfast, among other delicious Chinese breakfast specialties that reminded me of my childhood :')

We got some other street foods along the way to our next stop: Lungshan Temple.

I just wanted to say- at this point, we were beyond sweaty and dying. We stopped by several 7Elevens to get AC breaks and water. I got my last tastes of Asian mangos too..

One of the most interesting things about temples in Taipei City were that many of them were almost embedded into the buildings. One building block would look like any other Asian city block, but right smack in the middle would be one section that is extremely ornate, bright red, and designed completely different. It was astounding and so unique.

10AM - The Taipei Botanical Garden was our next stop. It was a mf-ing journey getting to this next point. It was so hot at this point of the day, we were just exhausted and seeking refuge. We finally got to the garden and oh my god, it was beautiful. It was a massive park full of all sorts of foliage and animals. And nai-nais and ye-yes (Chinese grandmas and grandpas). We found a spot in the park to just sit, people watch, and I recall talking about serial crime for some reason. Mind you, we were on day 55+ of nonstop traveling across Asia. 

12PM - Once we mustered up the energy, we made our way to the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and Liberty Square. It was MUCH more grand than I imagined it to be. It's an entire square, garden, second garden, and giant hall dedicated to a military and political leader who made large efforts in attempting to take back control over mainland China in the 50's. Fun Fact: Taiwan is officially called the Republic of China, which contrasts the People's Republic of China (mainland China). Lots and lots of beef still lol.

1:30PM - We decided at this point that it was too mf-ing hot. Like too hot. We were so done. So we took the train back to Taipei Station, and planned to look for a movie theater to pass time until the night markets opened. We ended up in Q-Square, which was connected to the railway station. Lion King and Toy Story 4 were sold out, so we ended up watching The Current War with Benedict Cumberbatch. It was good, but I also took such a nice nap. There was literally good food like EVERYWHERE, but we wanted to save our stomachs for the night market.

3:00PM - After the movie + perhaps some tater tots/fries that slipped in somewhere, we started making our way to Shilin Night Market. In retrospect, there were way more night markets that didn't require going all the way to Shilin District, but this was one of the more famous night markets, so I figured why not. It was absolutely worth it. We ate soo much street food from fried tofu sticks/french fries (my absolute favorites. They were seasoned with just salt and pepper and I was OBSESSED.), black pepper buns (baked in a deep charcoal pot and absolutely scrumptious), aiyu jelly drink (weird and flavorless, we did not understand), small sausage in large sausage (Rachael waited for a Michellin star rated place and said it was worth the wait!), mee sua vermicelli (SO GOOD. Starchy- just the way I like it), and so much more. So, so, so much more. There's literally something for everyone!! I also introduced Rachael to rose apples, which look like apples, but taste kind of like an apple/pear fusion and are so sweet, juicy, and crunchy. I discovered them in Malaysia and fell in love. There were also a ton of small accessory and clothing shops, so I got to pick up some cute knick knacks like a dumpling and Pikachu earring stud!

5:00PM - It was getting dark and we had eaten ourselves content, so we decided to head back to the airport. It took a little over an hour to get back, but we still had plenty of time to grab our things and take showers at the airport. They were actually really nice private bathroom/showers. 

8:00PM - We were still stuffed beyond imagineable at this point, so skipped dinner and just bought some souvenirs at the airport like pineapple cakes and postcards. I may or may not have bought a gutetama keychain. 

Sooo there you go! 24 hours in Taipei. After visiting for just the day, I cannot WAIT to go back. I loved the food, people, and culture. That being said, there are many places we didn't get a chance to see. I've listed them below in case you'd lke to include those in your itinerary :)
