## 5 Years Later...

Well, we're finally here fam. We did the damn thing, however long it took. I'm just proud to say that **I'm officially done with undergrad**. My college experience was unconventional to say the least, but I wouldn't change a thing. This past year in particular- my final year of undergrad has _truly_ been phenomenal. I can’t even believe some of the experiences that I got the privilege to have. From finally being able to study abroad (in INDIA) to landing my dream job to attending a conference of 250+ WOMEN OF COLOR celebrating WOMEN OF COLOR, I literally couldn't be more thankful for all the flippin punches to the face that life has thrown me to get to where I am today. That being said, I cannot thank those who were a part of my journey enough for providing me mentorship, inspiration, and support. 


I started at the University of Washington in 2014 following the path I had chosen at the end of high school, which like many of my previous career aspirations, was based off of my favorite TV show at the time- _Grey's Anatomy._ I wanted to be a doctor because that's what I thought a good Asian kid was supposed to do, and honestly, I had watched enough of that show to know soomething right? Lmao, no. After volunteering at Harborview Medical Center for over a year and taking just the intro chemistry series at UW, I knew it wasn't for me. So I pivoted career paths. And again. And again. It took me **six** reorientations to finally land on a path for the last 2 years of college, which included a 5th year to finish my requirements. Now, I have a Bachelors of Science in Informatics with a focus on Data Science, Bachelors of Arts in Communications with an emphasis on Digital Technology & Media, and the Husky Leadership Certificate. The process of getting to this point was by no means easy, but if you're interested in learning more about my experience, I'd love to share! I can definitely tell you more about facing immigrant guilt when it comes to making your career decisions, juggling 4 part-time jobs as a full-time student to pay for school and rent, and leveraging professional social networks to build out your network and potentially land you a job. If you're interested, shoot me a message at daisyzxie@gmail.com.

That being said, I've learned a _lot_ throughout the years, and especially at all the conferences and networking events I went to during Spring quarter. I wanted to compile a tdlr; of some sorts on my biggest takeaways.

**_Tim Salau_ at UWiB's Closing the Gap**-
Diversity is a virtue. Don’t let where you came from limit where you will go. Be more intentional about surrounding yourself with diverse communities, especially those that don’t look like you.

**_Lucas Welch_ from Highspot**-
The power of transparency and truth will lead to a positive long-term impact in reputation and collaboration.
Learn to become a “full-stack” communicator. Conciseness (in communication) is value- it demonstrates maturity and confidence.

**_Marla Jo_ from Milli Agency**-
Work is often 80% great, and 20% not, but if you’re able to push past that 20%, you’ll grow and learn immensely.

**_Lisa Fain_, CEO of Center for Mentoring Excellence**-
Always make a clear ask. Clear is kind and unclear is unkind. Stop apologizing!

**Tama Smith**-
_Find a way._ “If something doesn’t bring you alive, it’s probably too small for you.” - Maya Angelou.
Leave a person better for meeting you. Start saving EARLY.

You are not defined by the chapters in your life because you are writing a novel. Each individual chapter is but a piece in the mosaic of our lives. By itself, it cannot define us as people or leaders. We shouldn’t regret any single chapter as we learn from setbacks on our journey. Focus on finishing your novel strong. It’s all about impact.

You can only strain yourself until you can’t. You don’t have to be a chameleon to succeed.
