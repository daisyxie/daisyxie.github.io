title: Ways to Live A Sustainable Lifestyle
---
Living in Califoria has nearly been a dream- the sunshine, the festivity, the proximity to my boo thang :) The move to California was surprisingly not that big of a change. The one thing that DID get to me though, was how much lower the standard of sustainability is compared to Seattle. Back home, there are so many different kinds of recycling bins available, it's almost frustrating LOL. People generally eat out less, drive more environmentally friendly cars, etc. Living in California has really made me more conscious of my consumption and what I can do to better the environment that I work, live, and coexist in. In my journey to finding a more sustainable lifestyle, I learned a lot about things I really should know already, so I thought I'd put together a quick guide.

** Important Thing to Note **
Transforming your lifestyle into one that is more sustainable isn't about buying new things that are reusable or eco-friendly. It's about reducing your overall consumption. Meaning, if you already have plastic containers, don't just toss them into the recycling; use them for storage! If you have old clothes, repurpose them into reusable grocery bags, pillow stuffing, or blankets. Start being conscious of what you are buying, what it's stored in, and how you might minimize your waste.


Without further ado... How to Live a Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly Lifestyle.

Day-to-Day:
- Meal Prep
- Bring grocery/shopping/anything bags everywhere you go. Put a small compact one in your purse/backpack and 1-2 in your car trunk.
- Think before you buy - do you really need this? Can you find this at a consignment store/app? Do you already have something like it?
- Repurpose old clothes - there are so many ways you can repurpose old clothes. Some examples:
	- Reusable tote
    - Scrunchie 
    - Pillow case
    - Pillow stuffing
    - Gift wrap
    - Packing material
    - Quilt/blanket
    - Makeshift Patch (using graphic tees)
- Keep plastic bags for trash bags - Ideally, you wouldn't have any plastic bags if you're using reusable bags, but if you do end up with some, you can use them as mini trash bags or recycle them at most Target locations.
- Bring reusable coffee mugs/food containers/utensils at work or when ordering out - It hurts me everytime I go to work and see people using plastic containers, utensils, and cups at lunch and just tossing it in the trash. You as an individual can save so much plastic and waste by bringing your own eating equipment. Nicer restaurants usually have metal utensils, but doesn't hurt to bring your own kit if they end up being a one-time use place!

Bathroom
- Compostable floss - I myself haven't tried this yet, but I've been looking into either a water flosser or purchasing compostable floss when my current box runs out. You can find more options [here](https://wastelandrebel.com/en/zero-waste-dental-floss/)!
- Recyclable toothpaste containers
- Wooden/bamboo toothbrush - also compostable. Did you know that every plastic toothbrush that you've ever had is still sitting in a landfill somewhere? It's because they aren't recyclable. The rate at which people are consuming and tossing out plastic toothbrushes is astounding. Please, please, please read more [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/story-of-plastic-toothbrushes/#close).
- Menstral cup - I've been using menstral cups for a while now and they are INCREDIBLE. It definitely takes time to get used to, but once you do, it's so much less stress during the day and so eco-friendly. I got a [this two-pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072BMCGNW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon for $9. Only $9!!! If you think about how much money you spend on tampons/liners/pads and how much waste it creates, these cups are truly amazing.


Laundry
- Laundry dryer balls - Instead of buying dryer sheets, these balls do the same job AND they help detangle sheets and clothes. I got my 4-pack from Trader Joes and have been using one for months now and it's still in great condition.
- Chemical free detergent from restock shop

Kitchen
- Wooden scrub
- Natural sponges
- Reusable containers
- Produce bags
- Compost bin
- Beeswax Reusable Container Wraps

I hope this was helpful in jumpstarting a more sustainable and environmental conscious lifestyle. It requires investing time and patience, but absolutely feel free to take it step by step. Once you've reached a level of comfort and rhythm, the next step is bringing your impact to the community! Get involved and volunteer at beach cleans, local environmentally conscious organizations, political initiatives, etc.!
