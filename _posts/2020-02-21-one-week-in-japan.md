# A Quick Guide to Traveling Around Japan


I'm a hardcore planner when it comes to traveling. I like to do my research to make sure I get to see everything I want to see in an affordable, safe, and efficient way. A couple of my friends have asked for recommendations, so I figured I'd just put together a guide for others to use! For our first time in Japan, we went to Tokyo, Honshu (Mt.Fujii), Kyoto, and Osaka.

## Where To Stay
For Tokyo, I recommend Shinjuku, Shibuya, or anywhere around Chiyoda City. Shinjuku and Shibuya are on the more expensive end, but they're close to major shopping areas full of shops, gaming centers, and food. Chiyoda is like a city center, so it's easier to get to places, and AirBnBs are more affordable and spacious.

The other cities are relatively small and more centralized, so I'd just recommend finding a place near the city center or where most of the attractions are!


## Getting Around the City
The trains/subways can get a little confusing- the lines don't go the same way back and forth and there are several different companies that have lines so you have to make sure you buy the right tickets. I'd recommend downloading Rome2Rio, which is a super useful transportation app. 

Shinsansen (Bullet) train to Kyoto is about $90. You'll need 2 different tickets to board the train. I'd recommend going to the counter to buy it from the attendant instead of the machine, it'll make much more sense. Also if you're traveling frequently, I'd recommend getting a Rail Pass.

## Tips / Things to Note
Japanese Airbnbs ask for passport pictures to be sent to them- not sure why, but it's pretty normal.  
People are really patient and wait in lines going up escalators, so just be aware!  
Currency Exchange : 1 USD = 106 JPY  
Arigato-gozaimasu is thank you in Japanese, the last half is a formality but everyone uses it. I often heard people just say "gozaimasu" as a shortened version.  
**maps.me** is a fantastic offline map to use if you don't have data, it has crowd sourced data of attractions, restaurants, unique things, etc.  
It's really easy to send postcards in Japan and it's cheap! Just stop by the post office and they usually have a guide or the attendant can teach you.

## Where To Go
There are literally SO many amazing communities in and around Tokyo. I'll just put this list below and let you decide :) I've also grouped the regions by proximity so if you're ambitious, you can hit 2-3 in a day!

# Tokyo
1. Central Region  

**Ginza District**
- Tsujiki Fish Market- no longer a fish auction in the morning, but still worth visiting for excellent seafood!
- Toyosu Market is where you can view fish auctions now!
- Kit Kat Chocolatery and Cafe - make your own kit kat flavor
- teamLab Digital Art Museum - super popular, but a lil pricey and line is long

**Jinbocho Region**
- Book town, over 10M books in this area
- Imperial Palace
- Tokyo Station - the train stations in Japan are NO JOKE. Tokyo station has like an entire underground mall, Tokyo Character Street, so many great restaurants/bars, etc.

- Japanese Sword Museum
- Lots of gardens

**Ueno**

2. Shopping Region  

**Shinjuku**

**Kichijoji**
- Studio Ghibli Museum - *be aware that you have reserve tickets far in advance :( I didn't get a chance to get tickets this time around unfortunately.*
- Find Simon & Martina from Eat Your Sushi :)

**Shimo-kitazawa**
This is such a HIDDEN TREASURE. This area is full of vintage "thrifted" clothes. I airquote because they are pricey af. But regardless, the area is full of these hipster, artsy vibes. Music is also huge here, so there are a ton of record stores and instrument shops. Also tons of hidden bars, restaurants, puppy cafes, everything you could want and it's so lowkey!!

We also took a day trip to Lake Kawaguchi, which is at the foot of Mt. Fuji and spent a day+night there. It was suuuper relaxing- we biked around the lake, bathed in an onsen, and stayed in a traditional Japanese house. That was also really easy- we just took the bus from the Shibuya Bus Station.

# Kyoto  
Unlike Tokyo, Kyoto is a very calm and relaxing town full of culture and history. It was a nice break from the hectic nature of the big city.

1. Northern Region  

Arashiyama (bamboo forest)  
Golden Pavilion  
Tenryuji Temple  
Yokai Street - lots of little monsters guarding little shops  
- Also on this street, there's a little origami shop/school owned by a wonderful old man who is just the sweetest. Please pay him a visit if you have time :)  



2. Eastern Region  

Fushimi Inari Shrine (Fox Shrine)  
Gion (geisha district) - you can spot geishas walking around here!  

3. Central Region  
Nishiki Market - huuuuge marketplace in downtown with lots of street foods, souvenir shops, seafood, etc.  

Kyoto is known for these foods: fresh tofu, okonomiyaki, vegetarian food (look up buddhist vegetarian food- there are a couple temples that sell it!), matcha, and takoyaki.


# Osaka
This city is like a mix of Kyoto and Tokyo- it's just as many people, but depending on where you are in the city, it can be so calm and relaxing. It was a lovely town that I wish we had the chance to spend more time in.
