# A Quick Guide to Travelling Around Japan

I'm a hardcore planner when it comes to traveling. I like to do my research to make sure I get to see everything I want to see in an affordable, safe, and efficient way. A couple of my friends have asked for recommendations, so I figured I'd just put together a guide for others to use :)

## Where To Stay
I recommend Shinjuku, Shibuya, or anywhere around Chiyoda City. Shinjuku and Shibuya are on the more expensive end, but they're close to major shopping areas full of shops, gaming centers, and food. Chiyoda is like a city center, so it's easier to get to places, and AirBnBs are more affordable and spacious. 

## Getting Around the City
The trains/subways can get a little confusing- the lines don't go the same way back and forth and there are several different companies that have lines so you have to make sure you buy the right tickets. I'd recommend downloading Rome2Rio, which is a super useful transportation app. 

Shinsansen (Bullet) train to Kyoto is about $90. You'll need 2 different tickets to board the train. I'd recommend going to the counter to buy it from the attendant instead of the machine, it'll make much more sense. Also if you're traveling frequently, I'd recommend getting a Rail Pass.

## Tips / Things to Note
Japanese Airbnbs ask for passport pictures to be sent to them- not sure why, but it's pretty normal.
People are really patient and wait in lines going up escalators, so just be aware!
Curreny Exchange : 1 USD = 106 JPY
Arigato-gozaimasu is thank you in Japanese, the last half is a formality but everyone uses it. I often heard people just say "gozaimasu" as a shortened version.
**maps.me** is a fantastic offline map to use if you don't have data, it has crowd sourced data of attractions, restaurants, unique things, etc.
It's really easy to send postcards in Japan and it's cheap! Just stop by the post office and they usually have a guide or the attendant can teach you.

## Where To Go
There are literally SO many amazing communities in and around Tokyo. I'll just put this list below and let you decide :) I've also grouped the regions by proximity so if you're ambitious, you can hit 2-3 in a day!

TOKYO
1. Central Region
**Ginza District**
- Tsujiki Fish Market- no longer a fish auction in the morning, but still worth visiting for excellent seafood!
- Toyosu Market is where you can view fish auctions now!
- Kit Kat Chocolatery and Cafe - make your own kit kat flavor

**Jinbocho Region**
- Book town, over 10M books in this area
- Imperial Palace
- Tokyo Station - the train stations in Japan are NO JOKE. Tokyo station has like an entire underground mall, Tokyo Character Street, so many great restaurants/bars, etc.

**Akihabara**
- Anime/manga stores and cafes
- Maid cafes if you're into that..

**Ginza region**
- Ryōgoku Kokugikan Sumo wrestling
- Japanese Sword Museum
- Lots of gardens

2. Shopping Region
**Shinjuku**
- Gyeon National Garden
- Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building North Tower - open til 11pm, best view, free
- Memory Lane / Piss Alley  ** Really popular
- Golden Gai - strip of tiny bars and restaurants
- Takamaru [REALLY popular izakaya]
- Torikizoku (Shinjuku Kabukicho) [izakaya with all you can drink for under 1500Y]

**Shibuya** 
- Shibuya Crossing
- Super Mario Kart in the streets - *just be aware that you'll have to get an international driver's license to participate in this*
- Shibuya’s Bar Music
- SILKREAM ice cream!
- Sakura Tei - DIY okonomiyaki 
- 15-20 minute walk to Harajuku area too 
- In Harajuku, theres a cute hipster shop street call Cat Street I think

** Super popular

KYOTO
Unlike Tokyo, Kyoto is a very calm and relaxing town full of culture and history. It was a nice break from the hectic nature of the big city.

1. Northern Region
Arashiyama (bamboo forest)**
Golden Pavilion**
Tenryuji Temple
Yokai Street - lots of little monsters guarding little shops
- Also on this street, there's a little origami shop/school owned by a wonderful old man who is just the sweetest. Please pay him a visit if you have time :)

2. Eastern Region
Fushimi Inari Shrine (Fox Shrine)**
Gion (geisha district) - you can spot geishas walking around here!

3. Central Region
Nishiki Market - huuuuge marketplace in downtown with lots of street foods, souvenir shops, seafood, etc.

Kyoto is known for these foods: fresh tofu, okonomiyaki, vegetarian food (look up buddhist vegetarian food- there are a couple temples that sell it!), matcha, and takoyaki.




We also took a day trip to Lake Kawaguchi, which is at the foot of Mt. Fuji and spent a day+night there. It was suuuper relaxing- we biked around the lake, bathed in an onsen, and stayed in a traditional Japanese house. That was also really easy- we just took the bus from the Shibuya Bus Station.



Ueno

Tokyo National Museum

Taito City

Senso-ji temple ** SUPER popular, lots of souvenir shops and good food


teamLab Digital Art Museum - super popular, but a lil pricey and line is long
