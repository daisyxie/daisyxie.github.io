title: '144 Hours in Beijing, China'
---
This past summer, I went to China for the first time without my family. I was damn nervous, to be honest. My Chinese language skills aren't great and there was a level high warning for Canadian and American travelers going into China at the time. From my research, it seemed like a lot of foreigners traveling to China on a temporary visa ran into annoying complications as well. Despite it all, we somehow managed to figure it out and despite some major hiccups, we survived!!!

There are certain major cities in China that allow 3-6 days of stay on a temporary visa. The restrictions are that you must have a flight booked out of the country within the timeline, you can't travel outside of that city region, and the departure flight must depart from the region that you arrived in. For more details, and I **highly** recommend reading this several times, [visit here](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/tour/visa/free-transit-144-hours.htm). We only stayed 4 days to be safe, but in Beijing, you can stay up to 6 days!

## Where to Stay
We stayed at the Lucky Family Hostel, which was a little far (15-20 minute walk) from the nearest train station, but it was the most affordable hostel that wasn't a shithole and was still close-ish to major attractions like Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden Palace.

## Itinerary
Day 1
I spoke like 5 short phrases in Chinese to the customs man and that allowed us to breeeeze right through. From there, we took the train to our hostel. Not before stopping by to grab some dumplings though! We stopped by Qing-feng Steamed Dumpling shop and oh my GOD, my dreams FULFILLED. As you may have read in my bio, dumplings are my absolute favorite food and these dumplings were p-h-e-n-o-m-e-n-a-l. I ordered the 2 things I could read in Chinese on the menu and ended up with 2 dozen water boiled pork-and-chive dumplings and 6 steamed pork baos.
