title: '144 Hours in Beijing, China'
---
This past summer, I went to China for the first time without a long-term visa and my family. I was honestly pretty nervous- my chinese isn't great for one thing. There was also a high warning for Canadian and American travelers going into China at the time. And from my research, it seemed like a lot of foreigners traveling to China on a temporary visa ran into annoying complications like getting held at the airport unable to leave. BUT, we figured it out and despite some major hiccups, we survived!!!

There are certain major cities in China that allow 3-5 days of stay on a temporary visa. The restrictions are that you must have a flight booked out of the country within the timeline, you can't travel outside of that city region, and the departure flight must depart from the region that you arrived in.
