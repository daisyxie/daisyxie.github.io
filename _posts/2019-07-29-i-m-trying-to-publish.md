## An Ode To Paccar Hall

Paccar Hall, home to the Foster's School of Business. This building holds a unique place in my heart. Despite not being a Foster's student, I probably spent 85% of my college career in this building, whether it was working, studying, interviewing, taking classes, hosting club meetings, or eating overpriced Orin's food. Paccar Hall is home to some of my biggest failures-turned-obstacles and accomplishments. I got my first technical job in this building. I got my first and second major leadership positions in this building. I did 3 case competitions in this building. I interviewed 3+ times in this building. There is so much that this building gave me. As a Fosters student, you are fast-tracked to so many opportunities, there's no doubt about it. I'm grateful for the opportunities that I got as a student that got rejected from the Foster's School, but still reaped the benefits through stubborn grit haha. One of the most important things I've learned from being in this environment, is that business acumen and awareness and networking skills are incredibly helpful for your job search and success regardless of what corporate industry you enter. I strongly believe that any student that wishes to work after college (lol everyone) should get a fundamental business education, regardless of if you go into corporate, non-profit, etc. The business world is how the entire world operates! That being said, here are some tips and tricks for developing those skills without being a business student.

**1. Join a business club or organization**

**2. Find local professional networking events**

**3. Devote yourself to something you're passionate about**
