subtitle: Ex-student, dumpling connoisseur, powerlifter, traveller

For the longest time, I've identified as a student. Just this past June, I officially relinquished my title as a student at the University of Washington and entered a limbo before beginning my full-time career as a Consulting Analyst at Accenture down in Los Angeles. 

Throughout college, I've had the opportunity to really push myself outside of my comfort zone and growing through whatever life throws my way. I've participated in everything from international student organizations to powerlifting clubs to online student newspapers to recruiting tech talks, and much, much more. Along the way, I've picked up on little things here and there that I absolutey <i>adore </i>. Things like <i>writing</i>, <i>designing</i>, and anything creative, to be honest! Ever since high school, I've been telling my friend that I want to start a blog and a YouTube channel and begin telling my story, whatever it may be. I let my business/marketing selectiveness get in the way of publishing this until I had my ideas perfected, but what's the fun in that?

Now that I'm no longer a full-time student, I'm hoping to document more of my story and hopefully you'll follow along the journey!
